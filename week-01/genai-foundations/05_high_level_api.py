"""
Step 5: The High-Level API
-----------------------------

Everything in 01-04 (tokenize -> embed -> predict logits -> sample ->
repeat) is exactly what happens inside Hugging Face's `pipeline`
helper. This script shows the same result produced with just a few
lines, using the high-level `text-generation` API.

Important: we are using a PRETRAINED model here. We are performing
INFERENCE (asking the model to produce output), not training. No
weights are being updated - the model checkpoint is used exactly as
downloaded.

Model note: this uses full-size "gpt2" (124M parameters) from the
Hugging Face Hub. The first run downloads ~550MB and caches it locally;
subsequent runs are instant. If your connection can't reliably fetch
that, swap MODEL_NAME for "sshleifer/tiny-gpt2" - a tiny (~2MB) real
GPT-2 checkpoint with the same architecture/tokenizer, though its
output will look like near-random noise since it's undertrained.
