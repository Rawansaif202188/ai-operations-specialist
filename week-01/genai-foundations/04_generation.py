"""
Step 4: Autoregressive Generation
------------------------------------

Prompt
 -> Tokenize
 -> Model
 -> Next-token logits
 -> Probabilities
 -> Select next token
 -> Append token
 -> Run model again
 -> Repeat

This is the core loop behind every text-generating LLM: predict one
token, glue it onto the sequence, and feed the whole thing back in to
predict the next one. We implement that loop explicitly (instead of
calling a high-level `.generate()` helper) so every step is visible.

The model is a REAL pretrained GPT-2. Every generated token is an
actual sampling decision made from the model's real output
probabilities at that step - nothing is scripted in advance.

Model note: this uses full-size "gpt2" (124M parameters) from the
Hugging Face Hub. The first run downloads ~550MB and caches it locally;
subsequent runs are instant. If your connection can't reliably fetch
that, swap MODEL_NAME for "sshleifer/tiny-gpt2" - a tiny (~2MB) real
GPT-2 checkpoint with the same architecture/tokenizer, though its
output will look like near-random noise since it's undertrained.
